# movie_trailers

This is Project 1 of Udacity's [Full-Stack Nanodegree program] (https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004).

Movie information is hardcoded in entertainmentcenter.py using the Movie() class specified in media.py. This information is rendered into HTML by fresh_tomatoes.py.

To clone, run: git clone https://github.com/anishkothari/movie_trailers.git

To run, navigate to the directory and run 'python entertainmentcenter.py'. A new tab will open with the HTML output. Click on a movie's poster to view that movie's trailer. Links to the film's IMDB page and soundtrack are also provided. Enjoy!
